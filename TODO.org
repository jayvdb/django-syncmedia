* DONE [#A] pull() method also should be aware of per host directories
  - Just to avoid surely failure dirs (or accidental delete!)

  - By defayult each synced path is relative to PROJECT_PATH, but on
    some Hosts it might be userfull to specify a different one.

* TODO [#C] let the Host table resides on a separate DB than the django site default
  + define a settings variable SYNCMEDIA_DB (default to the global db)
  + apply ORM operation to the SYNCMEDIA_DB
    - initializa()
    - unregister()
    - get_this()
    - ... all other Manager methods
